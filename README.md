# SecureDNA Screening UI

A modern, privacy-preserving web interface for SecureDNA sequence screening using WebAssembly.

## Features

- **Browser-based screening** - All screening happens in your browser using WASM
- **Privacy-first** - No plaintext DNA sequences leave your browser
- **Dual view modes**
  - Summary View: Clean, deduplicated organism display
  - Structured View: API-faithful display with duplicate detection
- **Credential storage** - Save tokens and credentials securely in browser localStorage
- **Collapsible sections** - Hit regions are foldable for better readability
- **Rich visualization** - Color-coded tags, organism types, and regulatory classifications

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling
- **WebAssembly** for client-side screening
- **lucide-react** for icons

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

### Option 1: Netlify (Easiest)

1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Drag the `dist/` folder to https://app.netlify.com/drop
3. Done! Your site is live with HTTPS

### Option 2: Vercel

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel
```

### Option 3: GitHub Pages

```bash
# Make script executable (first time only)
chmod +x deploy-gh-pages.sh

# Deploy
./deploy-gh-pages.sh
```

Your site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

### Option 4: Any Static Host

After running `npm run build`, deploy the `dist/` folder to any static hosting service:
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- Cloudflare Pages
- Firebase Hosting
- Surge.sh

## Usage

1. **Load Credentials**
   - Upload your `.st` token file
   - Upload your `.priv` keypair file
   - Enter your passphrase
   - Optionally click "Save in Browser" to persist credentials

2. **Configure Servers** (optional)
   - Keyservers (default: `1.ks.prod.securedna.org,2.ks.prod.securedna.org,3.ks.prod.securedna.org`)
   - HDB Server (default: `1.db.prod.securedna.org`)

3. **Screen a Sequence**
   - Paste or type your DNA sequence (ATCG format or FASTA)
   - Click "Screen Sequence"
   - View results in Summary or Structured mode

## View Modes

### Summary View
Shows deduplicated organisms with:
- Primary Match (most likely organism)
- Alternative Matches (other potential matches)

### Structured View
Shows all organisms exactly as returned by the API:
- Most Likely Organism
- All Organisms from API (with index numbers)
- Duplicate detection badges:
  - "📊 Also most likely" - organism appears in both sections
  - "⚠️ Has differences" - duplicate has different metadata

## WASM Module

The screening logic runs entirely in the browser using a WebAssembly module. The pre-compiled WASM files are located in `src/wasm/`:
- `screening_wasm.js` - JavaScript bindings
- `screening_wasm_bg.wasm` - WebAssembly binary
- `screening_wasm.d.ts` - TypeScript type definitions

### Updating WASM from SecureDNA Repository

When the Rust code in the main SecureDNA repository is updated, you can rebuild and update the WASM files:

```bash
# Update WASM from default location (../securedna)
./update-wasm.sh

# Or specify custom path to SecureDNA repo
./update-wasm.sh /path/to/securedna
```

**Prerequisites for building WASM:**
- Rust toolchain installed
- `wasm-pack` installed: `cargo install wasm-pack`
- Access to the SecureDNA repository

The script will:
1. Build the WASM module from the SecureDNA repo
2. Copy the compiled files to `src/wasm/`
3. Show file sizes for verification

## Browser Storage

When "Save in Browser" is enabled, the following are stored in localStorage:
- `securedna_token` - Your screening token
- `securedna_keypair` - Your private keypair
- `securedna_passphrase` - Your passphrase
- `securedna_keyservers` - Configured keyserver domains
- `securedna_hdb` - Configured HDB server

**Note:** File inputs cannot be pre-populated for security reasons, but the data is loaded into memory and ready to use.

## Security

### Credentials

**This repository does NOT include any tokens, keypairs, or credentials.** You must provide your own:
- `.st` token file
- `.priv` keypair file
- Passphrase

The `.gitignore` is configured to prevent accidental commits of credential files:
- `*.st`, `*.priv`, `*.pem`, `*.key`
- `credentials/`, `secrets/` directories

### Privacy

All DNA sequence screening happens **entirely in your browser** via WebAssembly. No plaintext sequences are sent to any server. The application only communicates with SecureDNA keyservers and HDB servers using encrypted, privacy-preserving protocols.
